Background As many know, getting on a list for rare colors of Alden shell can be difficult and once you&amp;rsquo;re on a list there are tales of people waiting upwards of 3-5 years for a chance to buy the shoes they want. I seem to have lucked out a bit.

This one is a bit more expensive, but I think the individual pieces are priced well and worth it.
This is a baseline to get you started. Many would say that a navy blazer is required for this to truly be an Ivy guide and I&amp;rsquo;m inclined to agree. For the sake of the budget though I&amp;rsquo;m keeping it simple.</description></item></channel></rss>
