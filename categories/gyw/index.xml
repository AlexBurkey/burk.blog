Background As many know, getting on a list for rare colors of Alden shell can be difficult and once you&amp;rsquo;re on a list there are tales of people waiting for upwards of 3-5 years for a chance to buy the shoes they want.

I got on The Shoe Mart&amp;rsquo;s (TSM) list back in December of 2018 and got the email that I was at the front of the line for a model I was interested in in early June of this hellish year.</description></item></channel></rss>
