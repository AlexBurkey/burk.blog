The 270 welt and trim waist give their shoes a more elegant look than the wide chunky 360 welt that is a bit more common in the &lt;$300 tier. I also like the rounder and shorter toe shape of the last compared to Meermin. It feels a bit closer to the more &ldquo;American&rdquo; style that I prefer. Some of the Spanish makers/factories do this as well like Yanko which also sadly do not fit me. The closed channel soles are also a lovely detail but a bit more widely available from Spanish makers in the price tier.</p><p>Cavour is a great all-around menswear retailer too. A fantastic source for tailoring, shirting, etc. and a stockist for shoe brands like C&J, Edward Green, and Saint Crispin&rsquo;s. I think they perpetually have a 20% off your first order which applies to all full-priced items so if they have a pair of EGs or StC&rsquo;s that catch your eye you should check it out.</p><p>Cavour has a wide selection of basic/classic styles as well as a couple of <a href=https://cavour.co/en/product/616/croc-loafer>fun make-ups</a> that I really enjoy. In the end I decided I have too many penny loafers so I decided to stick with laceless and go with a pair of tassel loafers.</p><h1 id=ordering-and-shipping>Ordering and Shipping</h1><p>Cavour&rsquo;s website is really nice and easy to use. Easy to filter by brands, available sizes, and order search results in a number of ways, including price. VAT is automatically deducted when you input a US address. The shoes arrived shockingly fast. I ordered on Sunday June 14. The shoes shipped on June 15 and arrived on June 17.</p><h1 id=sizing>Sizing</h1><p>I measure 8.5D US and I went with 7.5UK, the smallest instock. The forefoot fit nicely but I think I either need a 7UK or the heel is just plain too wide for me. Even with thicker socks the heel slip was too much and I sadly had to return these.</p><h1 id=construction>Construction</h1><p>Listed as GYW these look to be ~270 degree GYW with a nailed-down heel. I haven&rsquo;t quite figured out how the waist is constructed. It looks like a fiddle-back waist but given the price-point and construction type I don&rsquo;t think it is. Other details:</p><ul><li>Closed-channel single leather soles</li><li>Combination rubber/leather heel</li><li>Fully lined</li><li>Leather insoles</li><li>Solid heel finishing: I love 270 welts since you can get much closer to the heel stack</li><li>High SPI on the welt: One of my favorite details on shoes in general</li></ul><h1 id=returns>Returns</h1><p>Two major issues with these shoes which led me to return them. Most importantly they didn&rsquo;t fit and a smaller size was listed as out of stock, so sadly an exchange isn&rsquo;t an option. Second, I ordered the <a href=https://cavour.co/en/product/2213/suede-tassel-loafer>brown suede tassel loafers</a> and what I received doesn&rsquo;t match that color. I&rsquo;m pretty sure a pair of the taupe loafers just got put into the wrong box or something. Not a big issue and it makes it easier for me to return them and just accept that they don&rsquo;t fit.</p><p>The return was easy though. I sent contacted their returns email address and they sent me link to print off DHL labels and paperwork and to schedule a pick-up time. A guy from DHL came right to the door, inpected the contents of the box, made sure the label was attached, and then took the package. I received a full refund just over 2 weeks later. An absolute breeze and the easiest return I&rsquo;ve done to date. I was even able to use the box they shipped in to return them.</p><h1 id=misc>Misc</h1><p>I normally don&rsquo;t futz about the packaging, but the packaging is really nice. The shoe box itself shipped in a larger green Cavour branded box that opened with a little pull-tap like microwave dinners have. No tape and no tools needed to open it. Inside was the shoe box, invoice, and a nice cardstock piece with more Cavour branding and some info (pictured to the left of the shoes above). The shoes shipped in two separate lined shoe bags and without shoe trees (I have too many already). The toes were stuffed with paper and nothing in the heels which I like. I&rsquo;ve had a few heel cups distorted by small plastic sticks meant to help keep tension in the front of the shoe. I&rsquo;m not a fan.</p><p>For the price I paid, and even retail, you get a really fantastic looking product in my opinion. I&rsquo;ve very <em>very</em> sad these don&rsquo;t fit otherwise I&rsquo;d more heavily consider them in the future. Hopefully someone can order from them and post a review a few years down the road.</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p><hr><figure class=grid><img sizes="(min-width: 35em) 1200px, 100vw" srcset="/posts/cavour-co-tassel-loafers-review/1-loafers-solo-shot_hu21899fa6ce8007175c7068222302ba57_5316835_500x0_resize_q75_box.jpeg 500w
