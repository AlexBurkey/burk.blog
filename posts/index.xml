Shoe care can seem really daunting and difficult. You&amp;rsquo;ve heard all about this &amp;ldquo;Goodyear Welt&amp;rdquo; thing and finally sent it and spent more on a pair of shoes than you thought was humanly possible. They&amp;rsquo;re supposed to last, but what do you need to do to get the best life out of them?</description></item><item><title>[Initial Impressions] The Shoe Mart: Alden Ravello Indys</title><link>https://burk.blog/posts/alden-ravello-indys-ii/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2020 13:19:18 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://burk.blog/posts/alden-ravello-indys-ii/</guid><description>Alden Ravello Indy boots from The Shoe Mart
Background As many know, getting on a list for rare colors of Alden shell can be difficult and once you&amp;rsquo;re on a list there are tales of people waiting upwards of 3-5 years for a chance to buy the shoes they want. I seem to have lucked out a bit. I got on The Shoe Mart&amp;rsquo;s (TSM) list back in December of 2018 and got the email that I was at the front of the line for a model I was interested in in early June of this hellish year.</description></item><item><title>$275 Starter Pack - Ivy Edition</title><link>https://burk.blog/posts/ivy-starter-pack/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Sep 2020 23:39:02 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://burk.blog/posts/ivy-starter-pack/</guid><description>I saw /u/silkk_&amp;rsquo;s starter pack here and was inspired to put together a version of what I wear almost every day. This one is a bit more expensive, but I think the individual pieces are priced well and worth it.
This is a baseline to get you started. Many would say that a navy blazer is required for this to truly be an Ivy guide and I&amp;rsquo;m inclined to agree. For the sake of the budget though I&amp;rsquo;m keeping it simple.</description></item><item><title>An Ode to Cobblers</title><link>https://burk.blog/posts/an-ode-to-cobblers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2020 10:47:25 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://burk.blog/posts/an-ode-to-cobblers/</guid><description>Cobblers are what make the world go &amp;lsquo;round in the world of stitched footwear. They can skillfully install after-market features like toe-taps or rubber sole protectors. Cobblers are the ones that replace the shitty stock leather soles with glorious JR soles or put real Dainite on your boots.

Their shoes are made in Spain Goodyear welt (GYW) construction in lots of solid leathers for around +$320 with a few really nice details that I love. They went on sale for around $250 so I jumped on a pair of brown suede tassel loafers.
Cavour Loafers and goodies
I was drawn to Cavour&amp;rsquo;s house brand partly because of the price-point, but also a lot of the construction details that put these over the top for me.</description></item><item><title>Bedos Leatherworks Toe Taps Review</title><link>https://burk.blog/posts/bedos-toe-taps-review/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://burk.blog/posts/bedos-toe-taps-review/</guid><description>Bedo&amp;rsquo;s Leather Works is a cobbler business located in Falls Church VA and is currently run by Steve Doudaklian. Steve does a lot of amazing work on seemingly anything made of leather. You might be familiar with some of his videos where he restored a pair of Allen Edmonds Strands or his famous Florshiem restorations. Check out his YoutTube channel it&amp;rsquo;s mesmerizing.
New Alden Loafers
I recently got a pair of wonderful Alden shell loafers from Brick &amp;amp; Mortar Seattle (above) and I wanted to extend the life of the soles a little.</description></item><item><title>Using Multiple Custom Domains With Github Pages</title><link>https://burk.blog/posts/using-multiple-custom-domains-with-github-pages/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://burk.blog/posts/using-multiple-custom-domains-with-github-pages/</guid><description>When setting up this blog I decided I wanted to use a different domain than the main one I already had. I spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out if it was possible to use GitHub Pages to use multiple custom domains for multiple repositories and exactly how to do it.
I finally found this post which set me straight on both counts. Here are both the steps outlined again and a non-exhaustive list of the things I bumped into but ultimately were not part of the solution.</description></item><item><title>First Post</title><link>https://burk.blog/posts/test-post/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jun 2020 11:12:43 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://burk.blog/posts/test-post/</guid><description>My First Blog Post Hey, Alex here! It&amp;rsquo;s been a goal of mine to have a blog/website for little posts and thoughts that I have about things. So here it is!
I&amp;rsquo;m using the static-site generator Hugo to build this. I just have to configure the theme to make the site look nice and I can write posts using markdown for formatting. I&amp;rsquo;m hosting it using GitHub Pages which is super easy and I highly recommend for static sites.</description></item></channel></rss>
