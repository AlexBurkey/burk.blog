Their shoes are made in Spain Goodyear welt (GYW) construction in lots of solid leathers for around +$320 with a few really nice details that I love. They went on sale for around $250 so I jumped on a pair of brown suede tassel loafers.

I spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out if it was possible to use GitHub Pages to use multiple custom domains for multiple repositories and exactly how to do it.
