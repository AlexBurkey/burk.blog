Keeps the dust and grime to a minimum. Also use after conditioning to get a bit of a sheen and spread the excess around.</li><li>Assortment of rags: Use for buffing, dusting, wiping down with water before applying conditioner. I use old cotton tee shirts.</li><li>Neutral conditioner: I recommend Bick 4. It won&rsquo;t darken any leather and it&rsquo;s not a cleaner at all so it&rsquo;s safe to use on all leathers. Use a little less often than you think. Likely every 6 months maximum.</li></ul><p>That&rsquo;s it!</p><p>That&rsquo;s also my baseline recommended care routine. Shoe trees and a few quick swipes with the brush after wear. Wipe down with a damp cloth and a bit of conditioner max every 6 months.</p><p>No fuss. Minimal investment of money and time. This is all you need for casual footwear especially. Polishes, colored creams, etc. are all extra.</p><h1 id=suede-and-roughout>Suede and Roughout</h1><p>The above doesn&rsquo;t quite apply if your shoes are made from suede or roughout leather. For those you will want:</p><ul><li>Shoe trees</li><li>Suede brush: Stiffer than horsehair and will help get into the nap of the leather more.</li><li>Suede eraser: Helpful to tackle spot stains</li><li>Suede spray conditioner: This is basically aerosolized neutral conditioner. I don&rsquo;t actually use this but would be remiss to leave it out.</li><li>Horsehair brush: A bit off-script from normal but I like a horsehair brush still to do the quick daily swipes. Suede brushes tend to be smaller so it&rsquo;s tough to get the whole shoe quickly.</li></ul><h1 id=dress-shoes>Dress Shoes</h1><p>If you need to polish your shoes, the above is unfortunately not all that you need. Here you have two options:</p><ol><li>Buy the products yourself and learn the skill of polishing shoes.</li><li>Pay someone who already has the products and knowledge to do it for you.</li></ol><p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with getting a little help or wanting to do it yourself. There are other guides out there on how to polish shoes. My short piece of advice is to stick with one brand. Folks often run into issues if they try to use different polishes and creams together, particularly if the goal is a mirror shine.</p><p>Lastly on this topic, I suspect many people will want to do it themselves. That&rsquo;s fine. But there are some <a href=https://burk.blog/posts/an-ode-to-cobblers/#repairs>damn fine shoe polishers out there</a> so maybe see if there&rsquo;s someone around that you&rsquo;d be willing to pay to do it.</p><h1 id=bonus-pointsnerdery>Bonus Points/Nerdery</h1><p>Here&rsquo;s a few extras that get you bonus points towards your shoe nerd card but likely aren&rsquo;t required.</p><h3 id=boot-trees>Boot Trees</h3><p>Unless the boots are +12 inches tall and the shaft actually needs support, you don&rsquo;t need boot trees. They do look nice though.</p><h3 id=cedarfancy-shoe-trees>Cedar/Fancy Shoe Trees</h3><p>In the US, cedar shoe trees are so common it&rsquo;s almost tougher to buy any other kind, but you&rsquo;ll hear people talk about the amazing properties that cedar has. Anti-bacterial, anti-microbial, helps them dry faster, etc. While all of that is technically correct, the primary job of trees is to help the shoes keep their shape. If you want them to dry, stuff them with newspaper. If you want anti-bacterial, spray the inside with some Lysol or a vinegar solution.</p><h3 id=multiple-brushes>Multiple Brushes</h3><p>Needed if you&rsquo;re using colored polishes and creams. Bonus otherwise.</p><h3 id=other-conditioner-products>Other Conditioner Products</h3><p>For casual leathers Saphir Renovateur and Venetian Shoe Cream (VSC) are super popular. I personally love both of them, but Renovateur is a mild cleaner as well so <em>don&rsquo;t</em> use it on crust leathers. Venetian Shoe Cream is less of a conditioner but is great to get a little shine to shell, is <em>the</em> product to use to restore Waxed Flesh leathers, and is the best choice for Chromexcel in my opinion. These are bonus points though. Bick 4 will condition nearly anything and won&rsquo;t cause any issues, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s my first choice to recommend.</p><h3 id=suede-waterproofnano-spray>Suede Waterproof/Nano spray</h3><p>Entirely optional. It will help keep the suede looking nice if that&rsquo;s what you desire, but suede is a lot tougher than many people give it credit for.</p><h3 id=cleaning-products-of-any-kind>Cleaning products of any kind</h3><p>This one is both controversial and depends more on your circumstances. Unless you&rsquo;re wearing your shoes in some actual nasty stuff (salt in the winter doesn&rsquo;t count), try embracing the patina. Instead of spending money on a harsher cleaning product, try a damp cloth and some elbow grease first. If you really think they need a clean, I suggest a professional. They&rsquo;re better than you. I don&rsquo;t own any Lexol Leather cleaner or anything. I do own some suede shampoo but I haven&rsquo;t used it.</p><hr><p>There&rsquo;s a wide range of nerdery in shoe and leather care. You can do way <em>way</em> more than this. You can do <em>less</em> than this! In the end they&rsquo;re your shoes and you can do what you want with them. Balance your time and money. They&rsquo;re just shoes and they&rsquo;re meant to serve you and your needs. Not the other way around.</p><p>Cheers!</p><hr><p><a href=mailto:awburk.blog+shoe-care-without-being-a-nerd@gmail.com>Contact me</a></p><ul class=pa0><li class=list><a href=https://burk.blog/tags/goodyearwelt class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">goodyearwelt</a></li><li class=list><a href=https://burk.blog/tags/gyw class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">gyw</a></li><li class=list><a href=https://burk.blog/tags/shoe-care class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">shoe care</a></li><li class=list><a href=https://burk.blog/tags/guide class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">guide</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=https://burk.blog/posts/ivy-starter-pack/>$275 Starter Pack - Ivy Edition</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=https://burk.blog/posts/an-ode-to-cobblers/>An Ode to Cobblers</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=https://burk.blog/posts/my-favorite-cobblers/>My Favorite Cobblers</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://burk.blog>&copy; &copy; 2020.
