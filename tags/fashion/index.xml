Alden Ravello Indy boots from The Shoe Mart
The grails of my collection. Alden Indy boots in Ravello shell cordovan from The Shoe Mart. These frankly have the most aggressive sole aside from my hiking boots, so I wear them when it snows.</description></item><item><title>20 Month Review: Alden Unlined Snuff Suede LHS</title><link>https://burk.blog/posts/snuff-lhs-20-month-review/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 May 2021 16:04:57 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://burk.blog/posts/snuff-lhs-20-month-review/</guid><description>Alden Snuff Suede LHS Loafers from Alden of DC
Background These bad bois are probably my favorite shoes. I was no stranger to snuff suede before this pair (see below), but I always admired this model from afar. In late 2019 I decided to bite the bullet and headed into Alden of DC to see what they had.

This one is a bit more expensive, but I think the individual pieces are priced well and worth it.
This is a baseline to get you started. Many would say that a navy blazer is required for this to truly be an Ivy guide and I&amp;rsquo;m inclined to agree. For the sake of the budget though I&amp;rsquo;m keeping it simple.</description></item></channel></rss>
