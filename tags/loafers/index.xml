Their shoes are made in Spain Goodyear welt (GYW) construction in lots of solid leathers for around +$320 with a few really nice details that I love. They went on sale for around $250 so I jumped on a pair of brown suede tassel loafers.
I was drawn to Cavour&amp;rsquo;s house brand partly because of the price-point, but also a lot of the construction details that put these over the top for me.</description></item></channel></rss>
