I don&amp;rsquo;t know how the myth got started, it&amp;rsquo;s entirely false. Real suede is an incredibly durable leather. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t show surface scratches or stains very much. It can get literally soaked and bounce right back. It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly easy to care for; it&amp;rsquo;s receptive to neglect and papering.

The grails of my collection. Alden Indy boots in Ravello shell cordovan from The Shoe Mart. These frankly have the most aggressive sole aside from my hiking boots, so I wear them when it snows.</description></item><item><title>20 Month Review: Alden Unlined Snuff Suede LHS</title><link>https://burk.blog/posts/snuff-lhs-20-month-review/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 May 2021 16:04:57 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://burk.blog/posts/snuff-lhs-20-month-review/</guid><description>Alden Snuff Suede LHS Loafers from Alden of DC
Background These bad bois are probably my favorite shoes. I was no stranger to snuff suede before this pair (see below), but I always admired this model from afar. In late 2019 I decided to bite the bullet and headed into Alden of DC to see what they had. Helpful as ever I was able to determine my size, but the shade of snuff on the pair they had in-store was a bit too brown for me.</description></item><item><title>[Initial Impressions] The Shoe Mart: Alden Ravello Indys</title><link>https://burk.blog/posts/alden-ravello-indys-ii/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2020 13:19:18 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://burk.blog/posts/alden-ravello-indys-ii/</guid><description>Alden Ravello Indy boots from The Shoe Mart
Background As many know, getting on a list for rare colors of Alden shell can be difficult and once you&amp;rsquo;re on a list there are tales of people waiting upwards of 3-5 years for a chance to buy the shoes they want. I seem to have lucked out a bit. I got on The Shoe Mart&amp;rsquo;s (TSM) list back in December of 2018 and got the email that I was at the front of the line for a model I was interested in in early June of this hellish year.</description></item><item><title>An Ode to Cobblers</title><link>https://burk.blog/posts/an-ode-to-cobblers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2020 10:47:25 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://burk.blog/posts/an-ode-to-cobblers/</guid><description>Cobblers are what make the world go &amp;lsquo;round in the world of stitched footwear. They can skillfully install after-market features like toe-taps or rubber sole protectors. Cobblers are the ones that replace the shitty stock leather soles with glorious JR soles or put real Dainite on your boots.

Their shoes are made in Spain Goodyear welt (GYW) construction in lots of solid leathers for around +$320 with a few really nice details that I love. They went on sale for around $250 so I jumped on a pair of brown suede tassel loafers.

I was drawn to Cavour&amp;rsquo;s house brand partly because of the price-point, but also a lot of the construction details that put these over the top for me.</description></item><item><title>Bedos Leatherworks Toe Taps Review</title><link>https://burk.blog/posts/bedos-toe-taps-review/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://burk.blog/posts/bedos-toe-taps-review/</guid><description>Bedo&amp;rsquo;s Leather Works is a cobbler business located in Falls Church VA and is currently run by Steve Doudaklian.

I recently got a pair of wonderful Alden shell loafers from Brick &amp;amp; Mortar Seattle (above) and I wanted to extend the life of the soles a little.</description></item></channel></rss>
