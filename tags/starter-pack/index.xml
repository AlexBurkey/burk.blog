This one is a bit more expensive, but I think the individual pieces are priced well and worth it.
This is a baseline to get you started. Many would say that a navy blazer is required for this to truly be an Ivy guide and I&amp;rsquo;m inclined to agree. For the sake of the budget though I&amp;rsquo;m keeping it simple.</description></item></channel></rss>
